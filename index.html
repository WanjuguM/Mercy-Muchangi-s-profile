                <h3>From Classrooms to Boardrooms: My Journey So Far</h3>
                <p>
                    Wondered what it's like to navigate the treacherous waters of going from teaching STEM to wrangling stubborn business cats in suits? Welcome to my career journey, where every step is a delightful (and occasionally chaotic) adventure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Classroom Chronicles</strong><br>
                    My journey began with chalk dust and curious minds at Tinker Education. Imagine herding eager students into the world of STEM, like a magician pulling coding skills out of thin air. Implementing a referral program was like watching mini-marketing executives run wild, boosting enrollment like a well-executed magic trick.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Branding Bonanza</strong><br>
                    Fast forward to June 2022, managing the branding project for Evora at Anno Domini Design Lab was a breath of fresh air mixed with panic - in a good way. It felt like playing detective to understand the client's vision, then translating it into a visual masterpiece. Finding a new design team mid-project was like switching horses mid-race, but crisis averted!
